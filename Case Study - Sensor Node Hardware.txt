Introduction
____________

Sensor nodes are at the core of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), enabling the collection and
transmission of data for various applications like environmental monitoring, healthcare, and
industrial automation. A typical WSN comprises multiple sensor nodes (motes), a base station,
and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visualization and control. This case study explores
the architecture, functionality, and components of sensor node hardware, focusing on key
elements such as sensors, motes, base stations, and GUIs, with real-world applications and
examples.

Components of Sensor Node Hardware
__________________________________

1) Sensors:

Sensors are devices that measure physical, chemical, or biological phenomena and convert
them into electrical signals. These signals are processed and transmitted by the sensor node.

2) Sensor Motes (Nodes):

Sensor motes are small, self-contained devices comprising multiple components that work
together to collect, process, and transmit data. 

3) Base Station:

The base station acts as the central hub of the WSN, collecting data from sensor nodes and
transmitting it to the back-end system for analysis. 

4) Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The GUI is the front-end system that enables users to visualize, analyze, and interact with the
data collected from the sensor nodes.

Challenges in Sensor Node Hardware
__________________________________

1) Power Consumption 

Sensor nodes rely on limited power sources like batteries, which can deplete quickly.
Solutions include energy-efficient protocols and renewable power sources.

2) Scalability

Managing large-scale networks with thousands of nodes is challenging due to increased
communication overhead and interference.

3) Security

WSNs are vulnerable to attacks like eavesdropping and data tampering. Encryption and
secure communication protocols mitigate these risks.
